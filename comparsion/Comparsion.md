**Time Complexity：** quantifies the amount of time  taken by an alogrithm to run as a function of the length of the string.

| Average TC | O(n^2)        | O(n(log(n)))  | O(n(log(n))^2) |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------- |
|            | InsertionSort | Mergesort     | Shellsort      |
|            | BubbleSort    | **Quicksort** |                |
|            | SelectionSort |               |                |

**Space Complexity:** is a measure of **the amount of working storage** an algorithm needs

**MergeSort:** O(n)

**QuickSort:**O(log(n))
